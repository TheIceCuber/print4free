    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am offering *free* 3d printing services, provided the print meets these requirements:
<br><br>
        Number One: The print must be appropriate. <br>
        This means no replica weapons. Something like a lightsaber or plane is fine, but no guns, knives, bombs, or anything like that. 
        <br><br>
        Number Two: The print must be small enough for me to print. <br>
        The build plate of my printer is 250*250*260mm (W*D*H), but I will not be printing anything that big. I can always scale down the design to make it smaller, so let me know if you want any adjustments to the model! 
        <br><br>
        Number Three: Colors<br>
        I will not always have a ton of colors, so don’t expect an exact color for your print! If you DO want a certain color, I will need funds to get that filament. In addition, multicolor prints ARE allowed, but might cause some trouble resulting in me denying them.
        <br><br>
        Number Four: Shipping<br>
        If you would like shipping, I will require you to pay for shipping or provide a prepaid shipping label.
        
        <br>
        <hr>
        Now that you know what’s allowed, let’s get on to how you can actually get something printer!
        <br><br>
        If you want to find something to print I would recommend browsing a site such as thingiverse.com for models, and sending me a link to the one you would like. 
        <br><br>
        If you have your own model, feel free to send me a download link or send it via the google fourm. 
        <br><br>
        With all of this being free for everyone, it does cost me a fair bit of money, and time. Any donations would be GREATLY appreciated, and please leave a review sharing your experience. 
        <br><br>
        Thank you,<br>
        -Josh
